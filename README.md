# credit-risk-classification

**Overview**

In this Challenge, I’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

**Instructions**
- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

**Results**

Healthy Loans:
- Precision = 1.00
- Recall = .99
- f1-score = 1.00

High-Risk Loans:
- Precision = .85
- Recall = .99
- f1-score = .88

**Summary**

Overall, I would recommend the company to use this training model. That is because it is able to predict the healthy loans at an incredibly impressive ratio. While it is true the High-Risk loan predictions aren't as robust as the healthy loans, however that should improve over time as more data is fed to the model.
